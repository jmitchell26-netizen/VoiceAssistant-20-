## 🎬 Recommended Presentation Structure

### **Option A: "Problem → Demo → Tech"** (Recommended)
```
1. Hook: "Ever tried voice control? It's frustrating..."
2. Problem: Show the window-switching issue
3. Solution: "I built this..."
4. LIVE DEMO: Research workflow (90 seconds)
5. Technical: How it works (context detection + AppleScript)
6. Learning: What this taught me
7. Q&A
```

**Why this works**: Demo early = grab attention, then explain how it works

### **Option B: "Story → Build → Demo"** (Alternative)
```
1. Story: "I was browsing and wanted voice control..."
2. Challenge: "But there was this problem..."
3. Build: "So I built an architecture that..."
4. Technical: Show code
5. LIVE DEMO: Proof it works
6. Q&A
```

**Why this works**: Build narrative, technical first, demo as proof

---

## 💡 Top Recommendations

### 1. **Practice the Demo Until It's Muscle Memory** ⭐⭐⭐
- Practice 20+ times
- Know exactly what to say
- Practice failures too!
- Film yourself

**Why**: Confidence comes from repetition. If you can do it in your sleep, you'll do it under pressure.

### 2. **Have a Backup Video** ⭐⭐⭐
- Record a perfect demo
- Have it ready to play
- Test playback beforehand

**Why**: Live demos are risky. A backup shows you're prepared.

### 3. **Focus on the "Why"** ⭐⭐
- Why did you build this?
- What problem does it solve?
- Why does it matter?

**Why**: People remember stories, not features.

### 4. **Pick ONE Technical Deep-Dive** ⭐⭐
- Don't try to explain everything
- Choose: Context detection OR AppleScript
- Show 10-15 lines of code max

**Why**: Depth > breadth. Better to explain one thing well than many things poorly.

### 5. **End Strong** ⭐
- Rehearse your closing
- Summarize key points
- End with confidence: "Thank you! Questions?"

**Why**: Last impression matters. Stick the landing!

2. **Acknowledge**: "This is why we test!" (smile)
3. **Pivot**: Show code walkthrough instead
4. **Confidence**: You know this inside-out

### Voice Recognition Bad:
1. **Try twice**, then move on
2. "Voice recognition can be finicky with ambient noise"
3. Show video or explain code

### Forgot What to Say:
1. Look at quick reference card (that's why it's there!)
2. Pause, breathe, continue
3. "Let me show you the interesting part..."

## 📞 Final Advice

### From One Developer to Another:

**You've built something real.** Most students do toy projects or follow tutorials. You identified a problem YOU had and solved it with custom architecture and system integration. That's impressive.

**The demo might fail.** That's okay. What matters is:
1. You understand what you built
2. You can explain why it matters
3. You can recover gracefully

**Practice makes perfect.** The difference between a nervous presenter and a confident one is usually just 10 run-throughs.

**You've got this!** You've done the hard part (building it). Showing it off is the fun part!
